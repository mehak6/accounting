## 💡 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Deposit Operation:**

```
1. User selects "Deposit"
2. User selects account (company or user)
3. User enters amount: 150000
   → Displays as: 1,50,000
4. User clicks "Submit"
5. System:
   - Creates transaction record (from: cash, to: account)
   - Updates account balance (+amount)
   - Records audit trail
6. Success message shown
7. Dashboard refreshes with new balance
```

**Database Transaction:**
```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (
    transaction_date, amount,
    from_type, from_id,  -- 'cash', 0
    to_type, to_id,      -- 'company'/'user', account_id
    description, reference
) VALUES (
    '2025-10-29', 150000.00,
    'cash', 0,
    'company', 1,
    'Office expansion fund', 'DEPOSIT'
);

UPDATE companies
SET balance = balance + 150000.00
WHERE id = 1;
```

### **Withdraw Operation:**

```
1. User selects "Withdraw"
2. User selects account (company or user)
3. User enters amount: 50000
   → Displays as: 50,000
4. User clicks "Submit"
5. System checks:
   - Is balance sufficient?
   - If NO → Show error with current balance
   - If YES → Continue
6. System:
   - Creates transaction record (from: account, to: cash)
   - Updates account balance (-amount)
   - Records audit trail
7. Success message shown
8. Dashboard refreshes with new balance
```

**Balance Protection:**
```
Current Balance: ₹1,00,000
Withdraw Attempt: ₹1,50,000

Result: ❌ ERROR
"Insufficient balance!
Current balance: ₹1,00,000
Withdraw amount: ₹1,50,000"
```

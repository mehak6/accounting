## Database Schema

### Companies Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE companies (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    address TEXT,
    phone TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    balance DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    company_id INTEGER,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT,  -- Note: Email is optional, only NAME is required
    role TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    balance DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies (id)
);
```

### Transactions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    transaction_date DATE NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
    from_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (from_type IN ('company', 'user')),
    from_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    to_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (to_type IN ('company', 'user')),
    to_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    reference TEXT,
    created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Transaction Types Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE transaction_types (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    type_name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    description TEXT
);
```

## Security Considerations
- Input validation for all user inputs
- SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries
- Data backup recommendations
- User access logging

## Key Improvements & Bug Fixes

### 1. Database Persistence (v1.0.2)
**Problem:** Database was created in PyInstaller temp directory and deleted on exit
**Solution:** Detect executable mode using `sys.frozen` and use `sys.executable` directory
**Result:** Data now persists permanently next to the executable in `data/financial_data.db`

### 2. Email Field Constraint (v1.0.1)
**Problem:** UNIQUE constraint on email prevented multiple users without email
**Solution:** Removed UNIQUE constraint, added automatic migration
**Result:** Only NAME is required, multiple users can have no email or same email

### 3. Dropdown UX Enhancement (v1.0.3)
**Problem:** Dropdowns only opened when clicking the small arrow button
**Solution:** Bound click event to entire entry field, added hand cursor
**Result:** Click anywhere on dropdown box to open, much more intuitive

### 4. Real-Time Amount Formatting (v1.0.4)
**Problem:** Amount field showed plain numbers (150000) without formatting
**Solution:** Added KeyRelease event handler with Indian numbering algorithm
**Result:** Type '150000' → Shows '1,50,000' instantly as you type

## Future Enhancements (Potential)
- Multi-user support with authentication
- Network database support (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Advanced reporting with charts and graphs
- Email integration for transaction notifications
- Export to multiple formats (PDF, Excel)
- Mobile companion app
- Cloud backup and sync
- Advanced analytics and insights
